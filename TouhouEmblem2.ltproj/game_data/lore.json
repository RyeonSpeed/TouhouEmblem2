        "text": "There are a few stats that are quite important in Fire Emblem. I will introduce you to a basic rundown of each of them, starting with character stats.\nHP: Health points. Your units will be defeated if they reach 0. In Standard Mode, any units who are defeated will be unusable permanently. In Baby Mode, any units who are defeated will return in the next chapter.\nSTR: Strength. This affects how much damage you do with physical weapons (Swords, Axes, Lances, Bows).\nMAG: Magic. This affects how much damage/healing you do with magical weapons (Anima, Light, Dark, Staves)\nSKL: Skill. This affects your accuracy (+2 Hit/1 Skill) and Critical Rate (+1 Crit/1 Skill). This is a dump stat usually lmao\nSPD: Speed. This affects your chance to dodge a hit (+1 Avoid/1 Spd). However, the most important part is that if you have 4 or more Spd than your opponent, you will attack them twice. \nLCK: Luck. This affects your chance to dodge a hit (+1 Avoid/1 Lck), and decreases the likelihood of an enemy critting you (+1 Crit Avoid/1 Lck). Luck is the best stat and totally not another dump stat :)\nDEF: Defense. You take one less damage from physical attacks for every point of Def you have.\nRES: Resistance. You take one less damage from magical attacks for every point of Res you have.\nCON: Constitution. Constitution offsets the speed loss you receive from a weapon's weight (More on that later). It also affects your ability to rescue (More on that later).\nMOV: Movement/Move. Movement affects how many tiles you can move in a single action. This is the best stat. Period.\nRAT: Rating. This is always set at 69. That is all."

Weapons with x/-- have a limited number of uses per chapter.\nWeapon Icon: Shows what type of weapon it is. Also has a letter called the Weapon Rank, which identifies how much Weapon Experience a unit needs to wield the weapon. \nWeapons with a \"Prf\" weapon rank are locked to certain units as described.\nMinimum Weapon Experience Needed To Wield Weapon:{br}[S: 251]{br}[A: 181]{br}[B: 121]{br}[C: 71]{br}[D: 31]{br}[E: 1]\nRng: Range. This shows up to how many tiles forward a weapon can attack.\nWt: Weight. This is the speed penalty imposed on a unit for wielding the weapon. This is counteracted with the Con stat. The speed penalty for a weapon can be calculated with (Con - Wt).\nMt: Might. This is how much damage the weapon does at base, not counting any other calculations.\nHit: Hit Rate. This is the base hit rate of the weapon, not counting any other calculations.\nCrit: Crit Rate. This is the base crit rate of the weapon, not counting any other calculations. If a weapon has no crit rate, it cannot make a critical hit.\nTags{br}Weapons have brief tags in their description that allow you to quickly identify what bonus abilities a weapon has.\nArmorpiercing: Weapon does bonus damage against enemies with the tag \"Armor\".\nAnti-Mounted: Weapon does bonus damage against enemies with the tag \"Horse\".\nBeastkiller: Weapon does bonus damage against enemies with the tag \"Beast\".\nAnti-Monstrous: Weapon does bonus damage against enemies with the tag \"Monster\".\nAnti-Fliers: Weapon does bonus damage against enemies with the tag \"Flier\".\nMagicbuster: Weapon does bonus damage against enemies with the tag \"Magic\".\nBrave: Weapon can attack twice as much as usual.\nDevil: Weapon has a (31 - Lck)% chance of backfiring and dealing damage to the wielder as well. This does not affect Monster units.\nReaver: Weapon reverses the effects of the weapon triangle.\nPhysical: This weapon which belongs to a usually magical weapon type now scales off of the user's STR stat and the enemy's DEF stat.\nMagic: This weapon which belongs to a usually physical weapon type now scales off of the user's MAG stat and the enemy's RES stat.\nPoisonous: This weapon inflicts Poisoned on the enemy after combat.\nPrf (Unit): This weapon is locked to the unit mentioned. (For example, Prf Reimu weapons are locked to Reimu).\nRecurring: This weapon has a certain amount of uses per chapter and recharges said uses at the start of next chapter."

Her powers of darkness are supposedly pretty strong, but they\u2019re mostly wasted on their user.\nRumia is a very high risk high reward character that can play into your cards well if you use her correctly. Her combat art, \"Apparitions That Stalk The Night\", invokes heavy fog over the battlefield, so thick that most units can only see 1 tile ahead. \nHowever, with that comes a huge stat bonus, including a coveted 1 movement buff. If you can work around the fog of war, Rumia can be a big boon for your army."

Quite funny that such a birdbrain could come up with a trick such as this. She also likes to sing in the dark.\nMystia is a dancer character, and for those of you not in the know, dancers are EXTREMELY efficient. Giving another unit a free turn is like having two of that unit.\nHer high mobility also allows her to reach pretty much any spot you need. Definitely a recommended pick no matter what team you're running."

This same duo are also often seen fighting to the death in the Bamboo Forest of The Lost, cited as their preferred pasttime. These duels usually take place around midnight, so travel near the forest during this time would be unideal. It is a popular theory that the forest is so lush due to these duels fertilizing the soil for hundreds of years.\n\nAs a counterpart to Mokou, Kaguya is a character more dedicated to stall, having incredible resistance to damage. This comes at the drawback of having horrible movement, only 3. \nShe can, however, mitigate this using \"In An Instant\", allowing her to warp to the side of an ally. This has a long cooldown, mind you, so position Kaguya well, as she'll be there for awhile."
